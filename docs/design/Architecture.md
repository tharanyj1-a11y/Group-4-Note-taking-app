# <Architecture>
## Context
<This section of the project will be the foundation and core features of our project. For our project we will start off with the main menu which will have the previous notes with a filter option, default sorting by most important, then most recent being at the top, along with this it will also have a new note button for users to create a new note for the lecture or day. When the new note is created there will be options such as highlighting, font size and font changing and many other features, but most importantly it will have the feature of summarizing your notes and allowing for a quick review of what was learnt in the lecture or day. At the end there will be a save button and also auto-save features and reminders for your important upcoming assignments or evaluations.>
